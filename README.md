## Midd Events

_Updated January 31, 2014_

### Development

To start a local dev server, run `php -S localhost:8000` or `make serve`.

Deploy script to deploy to Midd CS server is at `script/deploy`.

### Setup

Welcome to the git repository for Midd Events.  Here are a few things to get set up if you haven't used git or Github before.

 - Make sure you have git installed.  If you're not sure, run `which git` from the command line.  If you get a result (the path to the git executable), it's installed already.  For instructions on installing for your system, visit [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  The website is also a complete resource on git.

 - Get to the directory where you'll store the project, then clone (essentially copy) the repository with this command. (Don't enter the `$`.  That just means you're running this from the command line.)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/danasilver/midd-events.git
```
